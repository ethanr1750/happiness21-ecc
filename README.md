## 2021 World Happiness Scores

The world happiness score is affected by six key factors: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption. By analyzing data related to these factors, we can gain insights into what drives happiness on a global scale and how policymakers can create policies that promote greater happiness.

Introduction:
The concept of happiness has long been a topic of interest for philosophers, psychologists, and economists alike. In recent years, the field of happiness economics has emerged, which seeks to understand the determinants of happiness and how it can be measured and improved.

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication that ranks countries based on their happiness scores. These scores are calculated based on six key factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. In this Jupyter notebook, we will analyze data related to these factors and explore how they contribute to the overall happiness score of a country.

We will begin by exploring the data and conducting descriptive statistics to gain a better understanding of the variables involved. We will then use econometric techniques to examine the relationships between these factors and the happiness score. Finally, we will draw conclusions and make recommendations based on our analysis.

Overall, this Jupyter notebook aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors that drive happiness on a global scale. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the field of happiness economics and provide insights that can inform policy decisions aimed at promoting greater happiness and well-being for all
